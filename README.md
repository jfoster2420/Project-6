# Each Positons Role
- **Pitcher** - To throw the ball down to the catcher, with the goal of striking the batter out.
- **Catcher** - To catch the pitch thrown from the pitcher and help coordinate the game.
- **First Base** - To field the ball if it's hit to them, catch the ball from other infielders to force the out at first and to hold the runner on first (only if there is a runner there).
- **Second Base** - To field the ball and quickly throw to the base in which th play is supposed to be made at.
- **Third Base** - To field anything hit between the left foul line and shortstop. Third base needs quick hands and a powerful arm.
- **Shortstop** - Stands between Second Base Bag and Third Base. Shortstops are a one of the people turning a double play.
- **Left Field** - To defend the left side of the outfield.
- **Center Field** - To defend the middle of the outfield but also back up left and right fielders. 
- **Right Field** - To defend the right side of the outfield.

## Where Each Positions Play
- The Pitcher stands on the "Pitcher's Mound" which is in the middle of the infield
- The Catcher stands behind home plate
- First base stands barely to the right of the first base bag
- Second Base stands between the the first base player and the second base bag.
- Third base stands barely to the left of the third base bag.
- Shortstop stands to the left of the third base player and to the right of the second base bag.
- Left field stands behind third base player and shortstop
- Center field stands in a straight line with home plate and second base bag
- Right field stands behind the first base player and the second base player.

Further Development
For further development I would like to add more information about each position, how they preform in a game, and how each positions work together and run the field as defense.
